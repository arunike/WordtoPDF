# WordtoPDF

<p> This Python program allows the user convert word document into PDFs.
  User is first prompted to input, where they could enter the exact location of word document.
  Then, user can enter the exact output location of the file and conversion will begin.
  For example: If I input the input location (\Downloads\resume), it will read the word document and convert it and save it to the location you prefer (you do not have to enter ".docx" nor ".pdf" file extension.
